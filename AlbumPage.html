		<h1>Fear of Missing Out</h1>
		<h2>The Bombpops</h2>
		<h3>Released on February 10, 2017 </h3>
		<p>Fat Wreck Chords family)THE BOMBPOPS are finally delivering with their highly-anticipated debut full-length, Fear of Missing Out. A handful of lineup changes over the past few years delayed progress, but co-founders and frontwomen Jen Razavl and Poll van Dam finally secured their dream rhythm section and haven't looked back since. The current iteration of the band finally allowed Jen and Poll to go full steam ahead and unlock the massive potential that's been tantalizing BOMBPOPS fans all along. Fear of Missing Out unleashes a sharp mix of intensity and poppiness, from the infectious harmonies of "CA In July" to the shotgun blast drive of "Brake Lights" and "I Can't". The album's blend of catchiness and energy is off the charts. THE BOMBPOPS teamed up with Chris Fogal of legendary pop-punk band The Gamits as producer, elevating their songs even further with his shine and polish. Although it was a long road to completion, this charged up pop-punk masterpiece was certainly worth the wait.</p>
